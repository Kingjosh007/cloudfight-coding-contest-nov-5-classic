# Cloudfight Coding Contest (#Classic - Nov 5, 2021)

On November 5th, 2021, I took part into an online coding contest called **Cloudfight Coding Contest (CCC)**.
This contest is a **classic** contest, where you have to write a program to solve a multi-level problem.
This repo was created for that purpose.
